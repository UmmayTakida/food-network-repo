                    <p>diet food (or dietetic food) refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce
                        fat,carbohydrates, and/or sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or diet. Such
                        foods are usually intended to assist in weight loss or a change in body type, although
                        bodybuilding supplements are designed to increase weight</p>

                    <h2>Baked_potato</h2>
                    <p>I like to use russet potatoes here, as their skin really puffs up and becomes crisp in the oven.
                        Along with the potatoes, you’ll just need olive oil and salt to make this baked potato recipe.
                        Once you’ve assembled your ingredients, follow these easy steps:

                    <h2>rice_pudding</h2>
                    <p>In a heavy saucepan, combine the water, rice and salt; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce
                        heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until water is absorbed. Add milk and 1/3 cup sugar;
                        bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered.

                    <h2>Salad</h2>
                    <p>Slaws are some of the best make-ahead salad recipes out there. Typically made with hearty
                        vegetables like cabbage, kale, or broccoli, they’re sturdy enough to be dressed ahead of time. I
                        like to accent the veggie base with a punchy dressing, herbs.
